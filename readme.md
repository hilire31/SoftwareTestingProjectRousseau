# Design Patterns Laboratory

**Laboratory 1-3: Fundamental Design Patterns**

Design patterns are established solutions to common software design problems. They provide reusable templates for addressing challenges in system architecture, improving code organization, flexibility, and scalability.

Design patterns aren't pieces of code but rather guidelines or frameworks that help in solving specific design issues across various contexts. They are typically divided into three main categories:

## 📚 Laboratory Modules

### Lab 1: **Creational Patterns** 
Focus on object creation mechanisms.
- Singleton - Single instance management
- Factory Method - Flexible object creation
- Abstract Factory - Creating families of objects
- Builder - Step-by-step construction

**See:** `creational_design_patterns/` module

---

### Lab 2: **Behavioral Patterns**
Focus on the interactions between objects.
- Chain of Responsibility - Request processing pipeline
- Command - Encapsulating requests
- Observer - Publish-subscribe pattern
- Strategy - Interchangeable algorithms

**See:** `behavioral_design_patterns/` module

---

### Lab 3: **Structural Patterns**
Focus on organizing classes and objects into larger structures.
- Adapter - Interface compatibility
- Decorator - Dynamic behavior extension
- Facade - Simplified interface
- Proxy - Controlled access

**See:** `structural_design_patterns/` module
